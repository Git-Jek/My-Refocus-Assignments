Hi my name is Gerard. I am 28 years old.

My hobbies are watching series and movies, playing video games.

My goal for this is year is to improve myself.

The reasons why I want to be a web developer are:

- To earn up to 60k per month while working remotely

- To develop a website for my future business.

- To master different programming languages.
